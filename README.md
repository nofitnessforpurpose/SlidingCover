<br>  
A version with grip lines and a front panel label recess, also a smooth variant are provided.  

<br>
<br>

The default repository format is STEP (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303"> ISO 10303</a> ) due to its high fidelity.  { STL files are surface geometry as opposed to solid model representations, often containing export processing artifacts }. <br>  
<br>  
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecad.org/" > FreeCAD </a> may prove suitable for viewing, handling and, if desired modifying STEP files.
<br>
<br>

### On-Line Preview   
Models might be viewed on line using the following links. Noting display of any mesh lines is a feature of the renderer and are not contained in the source STEP model. It is strongly recommended to use the source STEP file where ever possible, as any export process will introduce artifacts.

## Considerations
The model makes no accomodation for manufacturing tolerances, process or material - see Notes below. 
<BR>
Different materials will have varying performance.
